## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
EduRaw <- read.csv("Analysis/Data/EDSTATS_Country.csv",blank.lines.skip=TRUE)
GDPRaw <- read.csv("Analysis/Data/GDP.csv",blank.lines.skip=TRUE)
View(EduRaw)
View(GDPRaw)
sum( !is.na(EduRaw))    # How to sum the NAs in a frame
sum( !is.na(EduRaw$Short.Name))  # How to sum the NAs in a frame  

#Remove junk columns 
GDP <- subset(GDPRaw, select=-c(X.1,X.4))
  
#Remove empty rows 
GDP <-   GDP[!apply(GDP == "", 1, all),]

#Remove junk rows after a quick look
GDP <- GDP[5:235,]

#set headers
names(GDP) <- c("ISOcode","gdpRank","CountryName","$ in Millions")
table(GDP)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
